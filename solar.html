            <p><b>The solar panel</b> is a collection of solar cells (or photovoltaic), which can be used <br>
                to generate electricity with the effect of photovoltaic. These cells are arranged in a grid-like<br>
                pattern on the surface of the solar panels.Therefore, it can also be described as a<br>
                set of photovoltaic modules, housed in a supporting structure. A photovoltaic (PV) module is an <br>
                integrated and connected assembly of solar cells.
                Solar panels wear very slowly. Annually, their performance decreases only by <br>
                about 2 per cent (sometimes, or less).
                Most solar panels are made using crystal solar cells. <br>But Loom Solar panels are made of Mono-PERC solar cells,<br>
                 the latest type of solar cells commercially available in the market.<br>The installation of solar panels <br>
                in homes helps combat harmful greenhouse gas emissions and thus helps reduce global warming. <br>
                Solar panels do not lead to any kind of dirt and are clean.<br> It also reduces our reliance on (limited) 
                energy and traditional energy sources.</p>
